Continuously deploy a service 
=============================

# Exercise

We want to continuously deploy this small service using a CI/CD pipeline. 

# Acceptance criteria

- there should be a CI/CD pipeline testing and building this service

- the resulting artifact should be deployed to a container solution
 
- the deployment should support horizontal scaling

- short documentation of the setup. Also document why you chose a particular framework, service or technology

- we like to be able to reproduce the pipeline as well as the deployment 

# Hints

- we are using AWS

- we don't use stages

- building and testing pull request should be supported as well

- you have the freedom to choose any technology you think it makes sense

- commit frequently so we can see how you have approached the problem

####How to contribute your solution:

1. Fork the repo
2. Commit everything that you do in your fork
3. Create a pull request with your solution. Your pull request should include all source code which you used to create your solution.
